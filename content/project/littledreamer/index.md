## Summary of Achievements
LittleDreamer was the winner of the NUS Medical Grand Challenge (Medical Grand Challenge), awarded a S$20,000 top prize in the Nascent/Open category — the competition’s biggest award. LittleDreamer also won National runners-up amongst 57 other local entries for the James Dyson Awards, an award which focuses on engineering innovation.

This prototype was also featured in [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nus-budding-entrepreneurs-among-first-students-to-head-overseas-for-internships) and Chinese newspaper [联合早报](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/lifestyle/design-decor/story20210926-1197350), highlighting the project's societal impact and innovation.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Despite its early success, LittleDreamer was eventually discontinued due to several key challenges:

1. **Market Fit & Go-to-Market Challenges**  
   We lacked the regional market access and commercial partnerships needed to scale. While we did have support from Singapore's healthcare systems, the small market size for children with OSA in Singapore made business viability very challenging.

2. **Technical & Research Limitations**  
   As fresh graduates, we had limited expertise in the material and process innovations required. Key scalability breakthroughs would have needed:
   - Medical-grade 3D printing with silicone (not readily accessible).
   - Automation pipelines to turn facial scans into custom mask designs.

3. **Team Capacity & Technical Depth**
   Although institutional support was strong, the team lacked the specialization and resources to advance the solution to a scalable, clinically-deployable product.

## Reflections

This project taught us the **importance of team composition**, **domain expertise**, and **commercial insight** early in product development. Even with awards and validation, execution beyond the prototype stage requires:
- A solid GTM (go-to-market) plan, large networks and involvment in the start-up community
- Domain-specific networking, global knowlege of key innovations for solutioning and ideating
- Long-term ownership and commitment
